This project is a website designed for Alert Originators to login and be able to view past Wireless Emergency Alerts. The Alert Originator will be able to view alerts via pages of 9 alerts, denoted by their different types, eg: Alert, Update, etc... A filter is available for them to quickly help in locating a specific alert. The alert cards contain a map of the location, the date it was sent out, and the message number. When clicked, a modal appears which shows further information about users recieving the alert.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).
